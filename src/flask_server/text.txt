Let me tell you a little story. When I was a little kid I really liked to play football. I wanted to be like Messi and play at Camp Nou. However, I was really bad at it and now I’m not training at Camp Nou. I’m writing a medium article on embeddings. In this article, I want to show how are we going to split a text into parts. We first embed sentences. Then we compute sentence similarities. After that, we detect the split point in the text. After finishing this process we will go play chess with friends.
